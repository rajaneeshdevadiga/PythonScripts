# PythonScripts

This is how I used to run this script in my local machine...

To run the script --->>>> python searchdoc.py or  Use any IDE

It will prompt for document path --->>>> for example, C:\Users\myfile.docx

Next, It will prompt for word which we want to search --->>>> We can enter as much as words we want to search

Finally it will generate report of the words and their occurrences in the document.
